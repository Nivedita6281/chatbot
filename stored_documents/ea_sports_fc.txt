Transfer FC Points from EA SPORTS FC™ 24 to EA SPORTS FC™ 25
Thursday, 29 August 2024
Learn how to transfer FC Points from EA SPORTS FC™ 24 to EA SPORTS FC™ 25.
How to transfer your FC Points
If you have outstanding FC Points in EAS FC 24, you can transfer them to EAS FC 25. Read through the steps below to find out how.

The only way to transfer your FC Points from EAS FC 24 is by logging on to EAS FC 25 on your console or PC. You can’t carry over your points using the Ultimate Team™ Web or Companion Apps.

After you transfer your points on your console or PC, they’ll be updated in the Ultimate Team™ Web or Companion Apps.

 
The first time you log in to any of the modes in EA SPORTS FC™ 25, a pop-up message will appear to give you the option to transfer your points.

A few things to remember:

You can only transfer FC Points from EAS FC 24 to EAS FC 25 on the same console family.
For example, you can transfer your points if you play both games on Xbox Series X|S. You can also transfer your points from an older generation to a newer generation console of the same type, like from Xbox One to Xbox Series X|S. But you can’t transfer your points from EAS FC 24 on Xbox Series X|S to EAS FC 25 on PlayStation® 5.
This is not reversible. Once you transfer your EAS FC Points, you can’t move them back to EAS FC 24.
What if I’m an EA Play member? If you play EAS FC 25 on EA Play and transfer your points but don’t buy the full game, you won’t get your points back on EAS FC 24.
